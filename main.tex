% TODO List

% For some reason using the variable file in lua causes unexpected side effects

% (FIXED) LaTeX expands commands with a space, so the Lua parser gets confused because I use whitespace to separate fractions.
% If you write \phix/y -> \phi x/y; however, \phi x/y -> \phi x/y
% So this becomes impossible to fix, we can only write the macro
% "\\command " -> "command" -> "\\command" and remember that \phi x/y -> \phix/y
% So to write \phi(x/y) we now have to write phi x/y -> \phi x/y
% Perhaps there's a way to fix this

% Recursively expand curly and square brackets

% Possibly REALLY BAD problem, Lua tables aren't initialized in any particular order
% This leads patterns to be applied randomly, this is bad (makes previous hack non-deterministic)

% I think, at some point spaces are inserted before \ in the macro file
% "&aprox" doesn't match the "aprox" pattern but "& aprox" does
% This breaks fractions, for example 1/\epsilon -> 1/ \epsilon

% I think the last two problems can be fixed at the same time by removing luajson

% It would be nice to recursively insert fractions somehow
% The fundamental issue is discerning the start and end of a fraction and the hierarchy

% I think both fraction problems can be solved by choosing a better delimiter

% auto-apply curly brackets to some commands like sqrt, _, or ^

% (FIXED) Figure out how to auto-insert \\ at the end of an equation line
% Fundamentally LaTeX converts \n -> " " before we can detokenize
% https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/153506/insert-a-new-line-without-newline-command
% https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Line_breaks_and_blank_spaces#Line_breaks

% It would be nice to have a meta information file for each class that gets compiled with it

% (FIXED) Using the differential operator before = causes the pdf to fail to compile
% ppU0S = -> \frac{\partial S&=}{\partial U}, this makes no sense
% This also happens after the equals, goes away when manually aligning

% (FIXED) Fractions fail if there's no preceeding whitespace, this is a problem at the start of a line
% We should be able to add a start of line character to the pattern

% (FIXED) Diff ops. and likely other patterns fail at the end of the line, expects " " gets "\\"

% (FIXED) Fractions do not render when placed next to each other
% This is because the Lua regex engine will not match overlapping patterns

% (FIXED) Extend the differential op pattern to include partial derivatives

% (FIXED) Replace fractions with /

% (FIXED) Replace brackets with \left( \right) in all instances
