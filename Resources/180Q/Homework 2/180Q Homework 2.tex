\usection{Using a photodiode and oscilloscope}

\subsection*{Part b}
The laser is CW so we're only impedance matching at DC. The impedance of a BNC cable is $50\Omega$


\subsection*{Part c}

\usection{Aligning a lens to a beam}

\subsection*{Part a}

\subsection*{Part c}
The input power is $0$, the output power is now $0$, coupling efficiency is now $0$.


\subsection*{Part d}
The back reflected power is $0$, the input power was $0$, so the reflectivity is $0$.


\subsection*{Part e}
From the prelab we expect a reflectivity of $0.03455$, we measured a back reflection of $0$

\usection{Aligning a beam splitter}

\subsection*{Part b}
The input power is $0$, the $T_1$ power is $0$, and the $T_2$ power is $0$.
