\section*{Midterm 1}
We will have the first (50 min-long) midterm exam in class next Tuesday. Please bring your own scratch paper and pens/pencils. There is no need for anything else. You will not be allowed to use any electronic gadgets, notes, books, or cheat sheets. This said, you don't need to memorize very elaborate equations, such as Sackur-Tetrode formula. Keep your focus on understanding the essential physics, such as thermodynamics of the ideal gas, combinatorics for simple models, and related things. All of the material discussed so far in class is fair game.
