\section{Preliminaries}
Let $H$ be a separable Hilbert space \footnote{Inner product $\braket{\cdot,\cdot}$ space, where Cauchy sequences converge}. Vectors of $H$ are called kets $\ket{\psi} \in H$, functionals of the dual space are called bras $\bra{\phi} \in H^\ast$.

Fix an orthonormal basis $\{ \psi_n \}$ of $H$. For a continuous bra $\bra{\phi} \in H^\ast$ and , there exists a unique $\ket{\phi} \in H$, such that $\bra{\phi}(\ket{\psi})=\braket{\ket{\phi},\ket{\psi}}$ for all $\ket{\psi} \in H$ and that this bra can be represented as $\bra{\phi} = \sum_n $. We can now define the inner product as $\braket{\ket{\phi},\ket{\psi}}$

Operators are defined by their action on the basis

\section{Density of States}
The density of states is defined as
\begin{equation}
g(E) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\delta(E-E(\Vec{k}))d\Vec{k}
\end{equation}
Where $E(\Vec{k})$ is the dispersion relation.
For the Sommerfield model $E(\Vec{k})$. For the
